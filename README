*NYC Traffic Speed API

Some great API in the making....

**Description

***Data

New York City DOT’s traffic speed detector feed is a free service that allows various user groups (i.e. the general public, private sector, commercial vendors, transportation agencies, researchers, media and others) to download traffic speed information on a regular basis to use in their applications and research efforts. This data feed contains 'real‐time' traffic information from locations where NYCDOT has installed sensors, mostly on major arterials and highways within the City limits. NYCDOT uses this information for emergency response and management.
